For making a switch it entails following in the minimum

# support for 
- Credit card (at least retail credit card)
- Debit card (at least base debit card)

# support for networks
- VISA
- MASTERCARD
- RUPAY

Channels to support
- POS
- ECOM
- ATM
- CONTACTLESS
- Tokenization for Apple pay and Samsung pay

To be able to give any of the networks we will have to do certification for that network separately 

# The modules in MVP switch will be 

- Authentication
- Risk
- processing
- Authorization
- Settlement
- Refund
- Disputes
- Reconciliation
- Fraud management
- Analytics
- Reporting
- Compliance
- International payments (entails forex)
- Configuration
- Card issuing and its life cycle (self-printing and integration with, distribution, lost card, replacement, renewal, account closure, etc  )
- loyalty

Security 
- PCI and PA DSS
- ISO certifications
- Network certifications
- EMVco certifications
- Hardware security module integration 
- Key management etc.


This is just for MVP for switch there may be many more modules that I am not aware of.

so if you ask me what it would cost, I would say Rs 5-10 cr (atleast $1 million)
